Chess Snake is a type of puzzle involving
the movement rules from classic game Snake
and the attacks of Chess pieces.
This adaptation of the game consists in 
positioning two known pieces in a board with
a pre-created snake. Those two pieces have 
to attack the snake the same amount of times
for the game to be won. The player must move
through the board using the arrows in the 
keyboard (up, down, left, right) and place a
piece using space to try to win this challenge!
