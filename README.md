# CHESS SNAKE PUZZLES - REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
## IART-PROJ1 - 33_2.1B

In order to play our version of Chess Snake Puzzles, it is needed to have Python 3 and Pygame installed. After having those technologies in your machine, follow these steps:

<ol>
<li> In a command shell, go to the directory of this project</li>
<li> Run python3 &lt;path to the project/src/main.py&gt; </li>
<li> After running, the stats of each episode is printed on the shell </li>
<li> By the end of the iterations, the graph with the final conclusions of the algorithm's progress and the Pygame interface will appear with the final solution for the board</li>
</ol>
